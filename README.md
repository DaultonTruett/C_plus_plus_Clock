# C++_ Clock

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
    This project displays a clock in both a 12 hour and 24 hour format. The program is designed to allow a user to enter their current time and then modify the clock by adding 
    hours, minutes, and seconds to the clock with a dynamic updayte to the clock display.
    
# What did you do particularly well?
    I believe I designed the programs functions well and achieved all of the desired functionality with adding a dynamic AM/PM display that was not initally required.
    The input validation I integrated into the program works with all user input and allows for a smoother operating program. 


# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
    This program could beneift greatly from OOP principles and would clean up significantly from utilizing a class to organize the code. There are some areas of code that are     reused unnecessarily due to the program utilizing many functions without classes.


# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
    The hardest part of the code to write was updating the hour on the clock in order for it to be continuosly updated while cycling back once it hit > 12 or > 23. The 
    other part that I had the hardest time figuring out was formatting the input time with leading 0s and then passing that formatted time into the DisplayClock() function. 


# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
    The main skills I see being transferable from this project to other projects will be the overall problem solving techniques I used to get the code to work the way I wanted     it to. THis program helped solidfy some crucial programming skills using c++ for me because it required a good mix of sytactic knowledge and problem solving skills in         order to finish it.


# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    I attempted to add in-line comments only where I felt it was required. I made my functions and variable names as obvious as I could in order to allow them to speak for         themselves as to what their underlying functionality is. This process has allowed this program to read smoothly, adapt to a new program if it needed to be changed             slightly, and allow for future maintainence or updating.
